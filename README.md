My part of this project is for statistics test and backtesting, for live trading part you could view his pages

apply on other stocks if you wish. I use tinngo api (https://www.tiingo.com/) and backtrader platfrom (https://www.backtrader.com/).
For information about each version of the code you could read the log file for brief introduction and any feedback will be welcome.
